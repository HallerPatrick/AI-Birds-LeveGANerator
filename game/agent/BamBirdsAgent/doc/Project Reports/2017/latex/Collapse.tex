The strategy for collapsing a structure strives to detect a structure, which contains a pig, and then tear this structure down. Thus, this strategy is applied, if a structure with a pig is found in the level. It furthermore excludes the case that a stone object is behind the target, because we discovered that the strategy would then fail. Also, the bird is shot on an object that is either on the ground or low in the structure. For the confidence, impacts from the domino strategy are integrated. Those impacts can be seen above in table \ref{tab:dominoimpact}. We decided to include those impacts, as we strive to tip the structure over like in the domino strategy and not penetrate the material like in the strategy for targeting a pig.
