This strategy is intended to be a fallback in case no specialized strategy is applicable. It simply targets pigs, with varying confidence based on the colour of the bird, the number and the type of objects it has to penetrate in order to reach the pig. The calculation of this penetrating shot starts with a fixed value of energy, independent of bird type or materials, and is then sequentially reduced using a predefined impact mapping that considers the aforementioned parameters.

The foundation of this map are the values used by the game itself. In order to build a level editor for creating test levels ourselves, another project group reverse engineered the game and found files containing values used presumably for the physics calculation of Angry Birds. We used the values found in the file \code{Materials.json}, specifically the values for damage multipliers per bird and material combination. This file helped us to keep our own scale relational and consistent with the game's physics simulation. In the game files we detected eight distinct numerical values we adapted to our scale from 0 - 10. The mapping we used can be found in table \ref{tab:mapping}, with minor adjustments applied due to previous experience.\\
