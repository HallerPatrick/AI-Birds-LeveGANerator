The idea behind the predicate \emph{heavyObject} is to find such a heavy object above as many pigs as possible and dropping it on these pigs. The strategy thus relies on the assumption that said heavy object is placed at a position on purpose by the designer of the level (similar to strategies involving TNT blocks). A heavy object is, by definition of our knowledge representation, an object in the shape of a ball, since these are most likely placed in a position so they can either roll over or fall on pigs. Inspiration and benchmark for this strategy are levels 1 to 5 of the Poached Eggs stage, which the agent is able to solve by using only one bird.

To find out if this strategy is applicable, it checks if there exists a ball in the current scene that is above one pig. The strategy then starts calculating the confidence for the various targets of the shot. Possible targets are: the object the ball rests on (predicate \emph{isOn}), the object that supports the ball or the ball itself. The starting values (or potential of the shot) for the calculation differ by target, as we balance the strategy differently for each kind of target. The best possible shot to us is aiming for the object the ball is on if it is hittable, less so if it is not hittable, followed by the supporting object and the ball itself in this order. Although latter targets will probably never be at a higher confidence than the first two, we wanted them included so that the meta strategies have more shot options to chose from in case we play a level twice.

Finally, the confidence of the shot is calculated by increasing the potential of the shot per pig that is below the ball until there are no more (unique) pigs found below the ball or the confidence would exceed our upper boundary of 1.

An idea we had upon playing level 1-14 was to decrease the potential and by that the resulting confidence further if the ball was of small size. In this level there are a number of small-sized balls above pigs, it is not a good idea to aim for those however. The idea was discarded due to time constraints, but it may be worth considering.

Another weak point of \emph{heavyObject} is, that it does not take the material of the target or the bird in the slingshot into consideration. We skipped this due to the limited applicability and universal appeal of the strategy.
