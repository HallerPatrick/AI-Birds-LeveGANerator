The strategy \code{blackBird} delivers plans for shooting with a black bird. There is a separate strategy for black birds, because they have a skill that differs a lot from the other birds' skills. Red birds, yellow birds and blue birds each have a different skill, but they all have an impact in only one direction. Black birds have the ability to have an impact in more directions, because they explode and thus, destroy everything that surrounds them in this moment.

\code{blackBird} delivers two plans with different confidences. First, if a structure can collapse on another structure, an object is shot that belongs to the second structure. Consequently, the bird explodes in between the two structures and both structures are demolished. Second, again if a structure can collapse on another one, there is also the possibility to shoot at an object that belongs to the first structure. Thus, the first structure indeed collapses on the second one. This plan has a lower confidence as the first plan, however, so that it would only be chosen in a second try. It thus states another option for the meta strategies.
