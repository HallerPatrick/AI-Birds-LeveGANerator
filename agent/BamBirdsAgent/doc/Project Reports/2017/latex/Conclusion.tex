Over the course of this project we developed an intelligent agent playing Angry Birds on the code base of the BamBirds agent of 2016. For our approach, we tried to model the implicit knowledge humans posses about physical simulation games by formalizing our way to solve the levels.\\
The changes made us aware of errors and bugs in the code, which we fixed. Further, we reworked the code to adhere to software engineering principles and simplified the compilation, execution and distribution process.\\
Evaluation and the competition results showed, however, that our agent does not meet the desired standards of performance and does require improvements also detailed in this paper.
