The strategy \code{tnt} focuses on finding a TNT block and aiming for this object. It is assumed that the designer placed this object in that position on purpose and it has an important effect when shooting it.

The plan checks, if there is an object, which is both hittable and of the material TNT. It furthermore examines, if the TNT belongs to a structure. This is essential, as it has to be excluded to shoot a TNT that has no effect at all. Szenarios for this could be that either the designer might want to confuse the player or that a previous shot changed the szene so much that the TNT has no impact anymore. Once detected this kind of TNT, the object is shot directly.
